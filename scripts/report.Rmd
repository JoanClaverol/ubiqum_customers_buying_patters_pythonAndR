## Introduction 

Blackwell Electronicsâ€™ CTO Danielle Sherman has asked you to use data mining methods to explore the customer transaction data collected from recent online and in-store sales to infer any insights and conclusions about customer purchasing behavior, specifically:

* Do customers in different regions spend more per transaction? Which regions spend the most/least?
* Are there differences in the age of customers between regions? If so, can we predict the age of a customer in a region based on other demographic data?
* Is there any correlation between age of a customer and if the transaction was made online or in the store? Or do other factors correlate to an online or in-store transaction?
* Is there a relationship between the number of items purchased and amount spent?
This task requires that you prepare one deliverable:

Customer Buying Patterns Report. A zip file that includes:

* A two to three page Word or PowerPoint document in which you:
     - Summarize your findings and conclusions regarding the questions posed about customer purchasing behavior
     - Explain how the results of each classifier you ran support your conclusions
A narrative explaining the results of each algorithm you ran in RapidMiner, but the technical output is not needed in the report itself. Please only include it in a separate file so the mentors may review your work.

The steps in the following tabs will walk you through this process.


## Loading the data 

Let's start by loading the data on python and see the head (first 6 lines) of our dataset: 

```{python}
mainpath = "data/"
filename = "Blackwell_Hist_Sample.csv"
fullpath = os.path.join(mainpath, filename)

data = pd.read_csv(fullpath)
data = pd.DataFrame(data)
data.head()
data.dtypes
```

One cool thing would be to transform the 1 and 0 to "online" or "in-store": 

```{python}
data_list = data["in.store"]
data["in.store"] = data["in.store"].replace(to_replace=[0,1],
                                            value=["online", "store"])
data.head()
```

Let's change also the name for the region: 

```{python}
data["region"] = data["region"].replace(to_replace=[1,2,3,4],
                                        value=["East","West","South","Central"])
data.head()
```

## Checking at the stadistics of the data

Look for the *min*, *max* and *average values* for the numeric data: 

#### Statistics {.tabset}

##### Age

```{python}
array = data["age"]

# minimum value
minimum = min(array)

# maximum value
maximum = max(array)

# average value
average = np.mean(array)

# create a list to store the results
list_statistics = [["age", minimum, maximum, average]]
statistics = pd.DataFrame(list_statistics, columns=['variable','minimum',
                                                    'maximum','average'])
statistics
```
